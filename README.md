what
---

Valet is an XMPP chat bot inspired by [autobot][autobot]. The idea is simple:
Valet is allowed to run any executable you put in a special, configurable
directory.

When you send Valet a message it will interpret the first word as a command and
pass the rest as arguments.

How to build Valet
---

### Dependencies

On Ubuntu and other Debian systems:

    $> sudo apt install libpurple-dev libglib2.0-dev libmxml-dev libxml2-dev
    libsqlite3-dev libgcrypt20-dev

### Build lurch

Valet relies on [lurch][lurch] for [OMEMO][omemo] encryption, and so it has been
added as a sub-module. For our purposes you can run the following:

    $> git submodule update --init --recursive
    $> cd thirdparty/lurch
    $> cd make

### Build Valet


    $> make

Configuration
---

A sample config file has been provided and it resembles this:

```
[credentials]
username=user@server.tld
password=ourlittlesecret

[valet]
# paths can be relative or absolute
commands=etc/commands
libpurpledata=etc/account
lurch=thirdparty/lurch/build/lurch.so
```

The credentials should be straightforward.

`commands` is the directory where you will place the executables you want Valet
to have access to.

**It is strongly recommended that you run Valet as a special user and clamp down
access to the commands.**

`libpurpledata` is where libpurple should store its data.
`lurch` is the location of the `lurch` plugin you built. It should be correct by
default.
